# Netflix-Movies-and-Tv-show-clustering
This repository contains the code and resources for analyzing the Netflix dataset of movies and TV shows until 2019. The dataset was sourced from the third-party search engine Flixable and includes information about various attributes of the content available on Netflix. The goal of this project is to uncover insights, trends, and patterns within the dataset and develop a content-based recommender system using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

# Problem Statement
The problem at hand involves exploring the Netflix dataset to gain insights into the content available on the platform. The dataset provides information about movies and TV shows, their attributes, and their availability in different countries. By integrating this dataset with external sources such as IMDB ratings and Rotten Tomatoes, we can extract further valuable information.

The specific tasks to be performed in this project include:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Cleaned the data, unnested the Netflix content and tackled the null/missing values and conduct a thorough analysis of the dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and correlations among different attributes.
Understanding Content Availability: Determine the types of content available in different countries and identify any variations or preferences.
Analyzing Netflix's Focus: Investigate whether Netflix has been increasingly focusing on TV shows rather than movies in recent years.
Clustering Similar Content: Utilize text-based features to cluster similar content, enabling the development of a content-based recommender system.
